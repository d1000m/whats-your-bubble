    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Despite appearances, Reddit is the 19th most popular website in the world, behind only Weibo, Facebook, and Youtube in social media (Alexa, 2021). Its design creates an online environment that is distinct from other social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in that it is chiefly organized not around individuals, but communities. Instead of following other users directly, users join subreddits whose posts are created and curated by the users subscribed to them. On Reddit, the content of a post is much more visible than the author who posted it. Downplaying the role of the author does not eliminate their impact, and subscribing to a subreddit is comparable to "following" its most prominent authors - or at least a subset of their output. Who are you following? Where else do they post? On Reddit, it is difficult to tell.</p>
    <p>This visualization maps subreddits by the authors that create their content, using a novel method to identify the extent to which subreddits are influenced by the authors shared between them - the greater the shared influence, the stronger the connection. While many relationships are as expected (r/energy and r/environment share a strong connection), there are interesting and perplexing connections to be found (r/worldnews is squarely in the "mainstream" cluster, while r/worldpolitics is central to the libertarian bubble, along with r/toronto and r/celebrities). The subreddits are grouped into "bubbles" whose authors are more similar to one another within than without, and clear meta-communities arise, enabling new lines of inquiry - such as the relationship between the various political subcommunities and "mainstream" Reddit.</p>
    <h2>About This Dataset (excerpt from project proposal)</h2>
    <p>This project will use a dataset I created from a raw dataset of all Reddit posts made in the month of January, 2017. Containing hundreds of thousands of posts made to tens of thousands of subreddits, the original dataset certainly qualifies as big data, but with careful analysis, it can be used to study the behaviors of every participating user on one of the world's largest social media platforms. Due to time constraints, I restricted my analysis to subreddits with at least 100 posts over the period.</p>
    <p>Curious about which users were not only active in, but central members of each subreddit, I used the raw data to simulate every subreddit's front page for every day of January, 2017. For each subreddit, I identified every user who had at least one post appear on the subreddit's front page and counted the number of days any of their posts spent on that subreddit's front page, creating a list of that subreddit's most central users. Then, I created a network with subreddits as nodes and shared users as edges. To create the edges, I selected the set of users central to each pair of subreddits, calculated the percentage of each subreddit's front page that was authored by that set, and took the geometric mean of the two percentages, producing edges weighted by the similarity in authorship between the subreddits they connect.</p>
    <p>The final dataset that will be the basis of this visualization project is an undirected network containing nodes labelled by subreddit and edges weighted by a percentage representing "similarity in authorship". This network identifies which subreddits share users with one another and reveals subreddit "bubbles" that interact far more with each other than the rest of the platform. I calculated the bubbles to be used in this project by using Gephi's modularity algorithm (weighted modularity, degree 1.0) to assign a modularity class to every node. So that I could later visualize the subreddits with many connections (and thus more heterogeneous userbases), I set every node's weight equal to its unweighted degree.</p>
    <p>Characteristic of social media data, this network is very sparse, with 4224 nodes and an average degree of 14.6. Degree is distributed exponentially, reflecting that the network's 30858 edges are densely concentrated among the largest subreddits like r/askreddit and r/pics.</p>
